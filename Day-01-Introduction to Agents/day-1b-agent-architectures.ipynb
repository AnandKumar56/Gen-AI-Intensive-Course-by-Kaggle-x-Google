Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n\n> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n\n**For help: Ask questions on the [Kaggle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kaggle) server.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ⚙️ Section 1: Setup\n\n### 1.1: Install dependencies\n\nThe Kaggle Notebooks environment includes a pre-installed version of the [google-adk](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) library for Python and its required dependencies, so you don't need to install additional packages in this notebook.\n\nTo install and use ADK in your own Python development environment outside of this course, you can do so by running:\n\n```\npip install google-adk\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.2: Configure your Gemini API Key\n\nThis notebook uses the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs), which requires authentication.\n\n**1.

In the top menu bar of the notebook editor, select `Add-ons` then `Secrets`.\n2. Create a new secret with the label `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.\n3. Paste your API key into the \"Value\" field and click \"Save\".\n4. Ensure that the checkbox next to `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is selected so that the secret is attached to the notebook.\n\n**3.

In his village of Dhampur, electricity was a luxury, internet an impossible dream. Yet, here he was, a self-taught prodigy, learning about solar energy, hydroponics, and coding. He’d scavenged parts, traded meager produce for old electronics, and poured over downloaded PDFs at the nearest town, a grueling ten-mile bicycle ride. The elders spoke of tradition, of the soil that had sustained generations. Rohan nodded, but his gaze was fixed on a different kind of harvest – a future where Dhampur thrived not just on rain and sun, but on innovation, a future he was determined to build.\nCriticAgent > The story presents a compelling setup for a character driven by ambition and innovation against a backdrop of traditional village life.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Show, Don't Just Tell, Rohan's Prodigy Status:** While the text states Rohan is a \"self-taught prodigy,\" it would be more impactful to demonstrate this through his actions or a brief, specific example of his ingenuity. For instance, could he have already jury-rigged a small solar-powered device for his family or used his learned knowledge to solve a minor village problem? This would solidify his \"prodigy\" status from the outset.\n2.  **Introduce Conflict or Obstacles:** The story effectively sets up Rohan's ambition, but there's an opportunity to deepen the narrative by introducing a specific obstacle or conflict. This could be the direct disapproval of a specific elder, a technical challenge he’s struggling to overcome, or a practical barrier like a lack of resources that threatens his progress. This would create more tension and make his determination even more significant.\n3.  **Hint at a Specific Future Vision:** The ending mentions a \"future where Dhampur thrived not just on rain and sun, but on innovation.\" To make this more concrete and engaging, consider adding a subtle hint about what this innovation might look like specifically. Is he planning to build a community solar grid? Introduce a water-saving hydroponic system? Develop an app for local farmers? A more specific glimpse, even a brief one, would make his ultimate goal more tangible for the reader.\nRefinerAgent > Rohan’s fingers, calloused from tilling his family’s small plot of land, traced the glowing circuits on the tablet. In his village of Dhampur, electricity was a luxury, internet an impossible dream. Yet, here he was, a self-taught prodigy. Just last week, he’d rigged a small solar panel scavenged from an old inverter to power his mother’s sewing machine, saving her precious kerosene. He’d traded meager produce for old electronics, and poured over downloaded PDFs at the nearest town, a grueling ten-mile bicycle ride away. The elders, led by the stern Patel, spoke of tradition, of the soil that had sustained generations. Patel had even scoffed at Rohan’s solar contraption, muttering about disrupting the natural order. Rohan nodded respectfully, but his gaze was fixed on a different kind of harvest. He envisioned Dhampur not just with a community solar grid, but with a water-saving hydroponic system he’d only read about, a future where the village thrived not just on rain and sun, but on innovation. A future he was determined to build, Patel’s disapproval and the scarcity of parts be damned.\nCriticAgent > The story is improved with the addition of a concrete example of Rohan's ingenuity (powering his mother's sewing machine). The introduction of Patel provides a clear antagonist and source of conflict. The future vision is also more specific now.\n\nHowever, the pacing feels a bit rushed in places. While the conflict with Patel is established, it's not fully explored, and Rohan's determination feels stated rather than earned through deeper struggle.\n\nHere are 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Deepen the Conflict with Patel:** Instead of just scoffing, have Patel actively try to dissuade Rohan or even sabotage his efforts in a small, believable way. This could involve the elders debating Rohan's ideas, or Patel subtly turning villagers against him by appealing to their fear of change. This would make Rohan's determination to \"build\" his future more impactful and earned.\n2.  **Show, Don't Just Tell, the Scarcity of Parts:** The story mentions \"scarcity of parts\" and \"meager produce\" for trades. To enhance this, include a brief scene or mention of a specific instance where Rohan is particularly challenged by this. Perhaps he desperately needs a specific component and has to make a particularly difficult trade, or he has to improvise with something unexpected. This would make his resourcefulness more vivid.\n3.  **Add a Moment of Doubt or Setback:** Rohan's determination is strong, but a brief moment where he questions his path or faces a significant setback (perhaps related to the scarcity of parts or Patel's opposition) could add emotional depth and make his eventual success feel more triumphant. This doesn't need to be a major event, but a small internal struggle or an external challenge that tests his resolve.\nRefinerAgent > Rohan’s fingers, calloused from tilling his family’s small plot of land, traced the glowing circuits on the tablet. In his village of Dhampur, electricity was a luxury, internet an impossible dream. Yet, here he was, a self-taught prodigy.

Patel had even scoffed at Rohan’s solar contraption, muttering about disrupting the natural order. \"This is not the Dhampur way, Rohan,\" he’d declared at the last village meeting, his voice resonating with the weight of their ancestors. \"The sun and rain have always been enough. Why invite trouble with your foreign gadgets?\" Some villagers, swayed by Patel's words and their own ingrained caution, began to eye Rohan with suspicion.\n\nRohan nodded respectfully, but his gaze was fixed on a different kind of harvest. He envisioned Dhampur not just with a community solar grid, but with a water-saving hydroponic system he’d only read about. A future where the village thrived not just on rain and sun, but on innovation. But doubt gnawed at him. The solar panel for his mother’s machine had been a stroke of luck, a fortuitous find. Now, he desperately needed a specific type of diode for a more ambitious project – a small weather station to predict rainfall for the entire village. He’d scoured every stall in the nearest town, offering his family's best mangoes for the tiny component, but it was nowhere to be found. He returned disheartened, the weight of Patel's disapproval and the crushing reality of scarcity pressing down on him. Was he chasing a mirage? Could he truly bring this future to life with nothing but salvaged scraps and downloaded dreams? He slumped onto his cot, the tablet’s screen casting a lonely glow on his face, momentarily dimmed by a flicker of despair. But then, his eyes fell upon an old, discarded radio, its casing cracked. An idea sparked. Perhaps, just perhaps, he could salvage something from it. He picked it up, a renewed sense of determination hardening his features.
