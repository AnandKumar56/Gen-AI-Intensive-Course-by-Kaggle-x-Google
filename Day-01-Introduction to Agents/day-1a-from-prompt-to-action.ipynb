An agent can do more than just respond to a prompt — it can **take actions** to find information or get things done.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Install [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Configure your API key to use the Gemini model\n- ✅ Build your first simple agent\n- ✅ Run your agent and watch it use a tool (like Google Search) to answer a question","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ⚙️ Section 1: Setup\n\n### 1.1: Install dependencies\n\nThe Kaggle Notebooks environment includes a pre-installed version of the [google-adk](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) library for Python and its required dependencies, so you don't need to install additional packages in this notebook.\n\nTo install and use ADK in your own Python development environment outside of this course, you can do so by running:\n\n```\npip install google-adk\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.2: Configure your Gemini API Key\n\nThis notebook uses the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs), which requires authentication.\n\n**1.

Add the key to Kaggle Secrets**\n\nNext, you will need to add your API key to your Kaggle Notebook as a Kaggle User Secret.\n\n1. In the top menu bar of the notebook editor, select `Add-ons` then `Secrets`.\n2. Create a new secret with the label `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.\n3. Paste your API key into the \"Value\" field and click \"Save\".\n4. Ensure that the checkbox next to `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is selected so that the secret is attached to the notebook.\n\n**3.

What languages is the SDK available in? How we can use them and Explain with Examples?\nhelpful_assistant > The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible, modular, and open-source framework designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and orchestration of AI agents. It aims to make agent development feel more like traditional software development, enabling developers to build complex agentic architectures ranging from simple tasks to intricate workflows. ADK is model-agnostic, meaning it can work with various large language models (LLMs) beyond just Google's Gemini, and it's also deployment-agnostic, allowing agents to run locally or on cloud platforms. It integrates deeply with Google's ecosystem, including Gemini, Vertex AI, and other Google Cloud services.\n\nKey features of the ADK include:\n*   **Code-First Development:** Developers define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in code, offering flexibility, testability, and version control.\n*   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems:** ADK facilitates the composition of multiple specialized agents into hierarchical structures, enabling scalable applications and collaborative workflows.\n*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Agents can be equipped with a variety of capabilities through pre-built tools (e.g., Google Search, Code Execution), custom functions, OpenAPI specifications, and integration with third-party services.\n*   **Flexible Orchestration:** Developers can define deterministic workflows (sequential, parallel, loop) or utilize LLM-driven dynamic routing for adaptive behavior.\n*   **Streaming Capabilities:** ADK supports real-time interaction, including bidirectional audio and video streaming.\n*   **Built-in Tooling:** It includes local CLI and web-based UI for testing, debugging, and evaluation.\n*   **Interoperability:** The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol allows agents built with ADK to communicate with agents developed on other frameworks.\n\n### Available Languages\n\nThe Agent Development Kit (ADK) is primarily available in:\n*   **Python**\n*   **Java**\n*   **Go**\n\nSupport for more languages is expected to be added in the future.\n\n### How to Use ADK and Examples\n\nTo use ADK, you typically follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Set Up Your Environment:**\n    *   Configure your Google Cloud project, enable the Vertex AI API, and install the Google Cloud CLI (gcloud).\n    *   Authenticate your Google account using `gcloud auth application-default login`.\n    *   Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.\n    *   Install the ADK Python package: `pip install google-adk`.\n\n2.  **Build Your Agent:**\n    *   **Define Agent Logic:** Write Python code to define your agent's behavior, including its LLM, instructions, and capabilities.\n    *   **Integrate Tools:** Equip your agent with tools by defining functions that the agent can call to perform specific tasks (e.g., searching the web, accessing data).\n    *   **Create Multi-Agent Systems:** Compose multiple agents to work together for complex tasks, defining how they collaborate and delegate. For instance, you could create a travel assistant agent composed of sub-agents for booking flights, hotels, and activities.\n    *   **Utilize Agent Garden:** Explore a repository of pre-built agent samples and solutions in Agent Garden to accelerate your development.\n\n3.  **Test and Debug:**\n    *   Run `adk web` in your command shell to launch a local development UI for testing and debugging agents.\n\n4.  **Deploy:**\n    *   ADK agents can be easily containerized and deployed to environments like Cloud Run or Vertex AI Agent Engine.\n\n**Example Scenarios:**\n\n*   **Multi-tool Agent:** Create a workflow that utilizes multiple tools for a single task. For example, an agent that needs to search for information, then process it with code, and finally present the findings.\n*   **Agent Team:** Build a multi-agent workflow where agents collaborate, delegate tasks, and manage sessions. An example could be a customer support system where different agents handle specific aspects of a customer inquiry.\n*   **Streaming Agent:** Develop an agent capable of handling streamed content, enabling real-time interactions.\n*   **Travel Assistant:** A practical example involves creating a multi-agent travel assistant where individual agents handle flight bookings, hotel reservations, and activity recommendations, communicating with each other via APIs.\n*   **Central Park/La Guardia Airport Q&A:** A demonstration of how to build two specialized agents—one for Central Park information and another for La Guardia Airport transportation—that can be routed to appropriately based on user queries.\n\nThe ADK provides comprehensive documentation and sample agents (Agent Garden) to help developers get started and build sophisticated AI applications.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can see a summary of ADK and its available languages in the response.\n\n### 2.4 How does it work?\n\nThe agent performed a Google Search to get the latest information about ADK, and it knew to use this tool because:\n\n1. The agent inspects and is aware of which tools it has available to use.\n2. The agent's instructions specify the use of the search tool to get current information or if it is unsure of an answer.\n\nThe best way to see the full, detailed trace of the agent's thoughts and actions is in the **ADK web UI**, which we'll set up later in this notebook.\n\nAnd we'll cover more detailed workflows for logging and observability later in the course.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 🚀 2.5 Your Turn!\n\nThis is your chance to see the agent in action.

You've just seen the core concept of agent development in action.\n\nThe big takeaway is that your agent didn't just *respond*—it **reasoned** that it needed more information and then **acted** by using a tool. This ability to take action is the foundation of all agent-based AI.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.
